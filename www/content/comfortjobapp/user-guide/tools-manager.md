# Tools Manager

The Tools Manager provides essential utilities for managing **system data** and configurations within the platform. It offers two powerful features to enhance data management and ensure smooth operations. These tools help users maintain the integrity of their system and migrate database table.

## Options ##

**Reset Option Data**:
+ The Reset Option Data feature allows users to **reset specific option** data within the system. Users can view the available options and choose which one to reset. This feature ensures that users can easily clear outdated or incorrect option data, restoring the system to its default or desired state.

**Migration Files**:
+ The Migration Files feature provides users with visibility into which migration files have been successfully migrated and which have not. Users can also initiate **migrations directly** from this section, allowing for streamlined data transfer and system updates. This functionality is crucial for maintaining data consistency during system upgrades or migrations.
