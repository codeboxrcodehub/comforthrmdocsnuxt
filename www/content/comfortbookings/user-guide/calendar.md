**Multiple Views**:
+ Switch between Month, Week, and Day views for the right level of detail.

**Filter by Status & Service**:
+ Instantly show or hide bookings based on booking status and available services.

* One-Click Details: Clicking on any booking event in the calendar opens a detailed modal popup without navigating away from the page with comprehensive information.
